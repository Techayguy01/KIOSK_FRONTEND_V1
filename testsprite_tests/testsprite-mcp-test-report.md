## 4️⃣ Key Gaps / Risks
- **Limited Scope:** Only a single test case (TC001) was executed in this run due to execution constraints. 
- **Recommendation:** Run the full test suite (TC001-TC017) in smaller batches or individually to verify the entire application flow, including Room Selection, Payment, and ID Scanning workflows.
