  "product_overview": "Nexus is a next-generation self-service hotel kiosk designed to streamline guest check-in and room booking through a modern, touch-friendly interface combined with an advanced AI Voice Agent named Siya AI. It features dual interaction modes (voice and manual touch) and simulates hardware for development purposes, offering a seamless, premium guest experience.",
  "core_goals": [
    "Provide a seamless, premium guest self-service experience through an intuitive user interface.",
    "Support two primary guest workflows: hotel guest check-in for reservation holders and walk-in room booking.",
    "Facilitate dual interaction modes—voice interaction via Siya AI and traditional manual touch controls.",
    "Simulate key hardware interactions including ID scanning and room key dispensing for development and demo.",
    "Ensure frontend operates as a renderer driven strictly by backend state and events, maintaining a 'Dumb Frontend, Smart Backend' architecture."
  ],
  "key_features": [
    "Welcome Page with animated gradient background, interactive animated voice Orb, and mode toggle between voice and manual touch.",
    "Dual Interaction Modes: Voice Mode featuring the AI Voice Agent and Manual Mode offering clear, touch-friendly action buttons.",
    "Room Selection Page displaying available rooms with images, prices, and amenities, supporting walk-in guest bookings.",
    "ID Scanning simulation with visual progress feedback for guest identification and verification.",
    "Payment and Checkout processing that reviews billing including room cost and taxes with simulated card payment interaction.",
    "Hardware simulation for ID scanner and room key dispenser to enable end-to-end guest flow during development.",
    "Global state management and frontend UI driven by backend state machine emitting intents corresponding to user actions, with no frontend logic assumptions."
  ],
  "user_flow_summary": [
    "Guest arrives at Welcome Page and chooses between Check-In, Book Room, or Help options via voice or touch.",
    "For Check-In: guest identification followed by simulated ID scanning and reservation verification, followed by payment verification if needed, then room key dispensing.",
    "For Booking: guest requests room, views available rooms with prices and amenities, selects room, completes payment, and receives room key.",
    "Throughout, user can toggle between Voice Mode and Manual Mode for interaction preference.",
    "Frontend UI state transitions are strictly driven by backend events and state machine, with frontend only emitting intents based on user actions."
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "Frontend strictly adheres to backend-driven UI state without internal logic overriding.",
    "Dual Interaction Modes function seamlessly with clear toggling and appropriate visual/voice feedback.",
    "Room Selection displays accurate room data as provided by backend/mock services with correct pricing and amenities.",
    "ID scanning simulation shows visual progress and provides completion feedback.",
    "Payment process displays accurate cost breakdown and accepts simulated payment inputs properly.",
    "Hardware simulation services respond correctly simulating ID scanning and key dispensing without errors.",
    "User flows for both Check-In and Booking complete successfully through all states as defined in the state machine happy path."
